# Studio

Studio makes lecture videos from scenes written as TSX components.
`app/studio-core/` is its renderer: a video folder plus a time in, one RGBA
frame out, the same pixels on every machine. Narration, transitions and
encoding to video are not built yet; `oculus studio` renders single frames
and lints.

## A video is a folder, and a frame is a pure function of it and `t`

```
video.json
components/   <Name>.tsx, one component per file
assets/       images, named by <Image src>
```

```json
{
  "size": { "width": 1920, "height": 1080 },
  "theme": "default",
  "scenes": [
    { "component": "TitleCard", "props": { "title": "Gradient descent" }, "hold": 4.0 }
  ]
}
```

- `hold` is a scene's length in seconds. A global `t` maps to a scene and a
  scene-relative `t` by summing holds (`Timeline`); a `t` past the end is an
  error that states the video's length.
- `theme` is a bundled theme's name or a `.json` path relative to the folder.
- `video.json` refuses unknown keys, an empty `scenes`, a non-positive `hold`
  and sides outside 1–8192 px.
- Component names are PascalCase letters and digits and resolve to
  `components/<Name>.tsx` through the `ComponentSource` trait
  (`FolderComponents`); a missing one is an error listing the ones there are.

## A component is `(props, ctx) => element` with a declared props schema

```tsx
export const props = { title: str(), bullets: list(str()), accent: token("color").default("accent") }
export const examples = { short: { title: "Gradient descent", bullets: ["…"] } }
export default ({ title, bullets, accent }, { t, duration, theme, size }) =>
  <Stack gap={theme.space.m} style={{ padding: theme.space.xl }}>…</Stack>
```

- `ctx` is `{ t, duration, theme, size: { width, height } }`, `t` in seconds
  from the scene's start. Function components used inside the JSX are called
  with the same `(props, ctx)`.
- The default export returns exactly one element. A component with no
  `props` export is refused (`{}` declares none): the schema is what lint and
  the inspector are built from.
- Builders: `str()`, `num()`, `bool()`, `list(x)`, `oneOf([...])`,
  `token(kind)`, `latex()` (a string of LaTeX source), each with
  `.default(v)` and `.optional()`. Before every call the scene's props are
  checked: a missing required prop, a wrong type or an unknown prop is a
  `Props` error naming the component, the prop path, what was expected and
  what came. Defaults are filled in.
- `token("color")` takes a token *name* (`"accent"`) and hands the component
  its value; any theme section works, dotted ones too (`token("motion.spring")`).
- `examples` are named prop sets. Lint checks them against the schema; nothing
  renders them yet.
- Motion helpers are prelude globals and pure functions of `t`:
  `interpolate(t, inputs, outputs, { easing, clamp })`, `spring(t, { stiffness,
  damping, mass })` (closed form, so any `t` samples directly), `linear`,
  `easeOutCubic`, `easeInOutCubic`, `cubicBezier(a, b, c, d)`, `mix(a, b, p)`
  for hex colours, `clamp`, `lerp`.

## Three primitives and a closed set of style keys

`Box`, `Text` and `Image` are the host elements; `Stack` (a column) and `Row`
are `Box` with `gap`, `align`, `justify` and `wrap` shorthands. Elements take
only `style`, `key`, children, and `src` on `Image`.

- `flexDirection` defaults to `row`, as in CSS. Use `Stack` for a column.
- `Text` children must be strings or numbers; to mix styles put several
  `Text` in a `Row`.
- `Image src` is relative to `assets/`. A missing or undecodable file is an
  error, never a placeholder. Decoded images are cached per renderer.
- Style keys are `STYLE_KEYS` in `app/studio-core/src/scene/style.rs`: size
  and min/max, flex, `gap`, `padding`/`margin` (`n`, `[v, h]` or four
  sides), `position` with `left`/`top`/`right`/`bottom`, `fill`, `radius`,
  `border`, `shadow`, `blur`, `opacity`, `clip`, `translateX`/`translateY`,
  `scale`, `rotate` (degrees), and the text keys `fontFamily`, `fontSize`,
  `fontWeight`, `color`, `lineHeight`, `letterSpacing`, `textAlign`, plus
  `objectFit` for images. An unknown key is an error naming the closest valid
  one.
- Lengths are px, `"N%"` or `"auto"`. Colours are `#rgb`, `#rrggbb` or
  `#rrggbbaa` only; a theme colour is just the value read from `theme`.
- `fill` is a colour or `{ linear: { angle, stops: [[offset, colour], …] } }`
  with a CSS angle (0 is to top, 90 to right) and offsets rising from 0 to 1.
- Transforms apply about the node's centre. `opacity` and `blur` composite
  the node and its children as one group; `clip` clips children to the
  node's rounded rect.

## Blur means what it means in CSS

- An element's `blur` is `filter: blur()`: the value is the gaussian sigma.
- `shadow.blur` is `box-shadow`'s blur radius: sigma is half of it.

## Text is never snapped to a pixel

Glyphs draw with vello's atlas cache and hinting off, parley does not quantise,
and taffy's rounding is disabled; no transform rounds either. Text that glides
must not step a whole pixel at a time, and `tests/subpixel.rs` measures that:
a line moving 0.25 px a frame must move its ink centroid smoothly.

## Fonts and themes are bundled, never the system's

- The fonts are Inter (variable: `opsz`, `wght`) and Manrope (variable:
  `wght`), compiled in with their OFL licences beside them. System fonts are
  never loaded, so a frame is the same on every machine; an unknown
  `fontFamily` is an error naming the bundled families.
- A theme is tokens only: `color`, `font` (`heading` and `body` families),
  `type` (style fragments to spread into `style`), `space`, `radius` and
  `motion` (`duration`, `easing` as cubic-bezier points, `spring` presets).
  Components read it as `ctx.theme` and it is frozen.
- `color.bg` is the canvas under every frame, `color.text` the colour and
  `font.body` the family of `Text` that sets none.
- The bundled `default` theme is neutral greys with the app's indigo
  `#5e6ad2` accent, Manrope headings and Inter body.

## The sandbox makes a component a bounded, pure function

- One QuickJS runtime per `Renderer` (or `Engine`), never shared across
  threads: render in parallel with one renderer per thread.
- Every load and call gets a fresh context: the prelude, the theme and the
  component's module are evaluated anew, and the context is freed and its
  garbage collected before the entry returns. A top-level `let`, a mutated
  global, `Math` or `Array.prototype` lasts one call, so a frame depends only
  on the component, props, theme, size, `t` and scene index, whatever was
  rendered before it. The prelude and each component are compiled to
  bytecode once; the fresh state costs about 0.15 ms a call (release build),
  under 3% of a 1080p frame, and the heap is the same after 2,000 calls as
  after one.
- 256 MB heap, 1 MB stack and a step budget counted by the interrupt
  handler, reset on every entry (a module load; a call, and again before its
  default export runs). Running out is a `Budget` error naming the
  component, not a hang.
- No `Date`, `performance`, `WeakRef` or `FinalizationRegistry`, no module
  loader (an `import` is an error at its line), no I/O. `Math.random` is
  reseeded before every call from the component name and scene index.
- `console.log` and friends go to `Frame::logs`, at most 200 lines a call.

## Errors are written for an agent to act on

Each `StudioError` says what is wrong, where, and what would be valid. One
with a TSX position reads like a compiler's — `Typo.tsx:4:5: <message>`, then
that line of source indented below — with positions mapped back through oxc's
source map. `kind()` names the variant for JSON. The CLI prints the message
unchanged.

## The engine renders one component without a project

`Engine` takes a theme, a size, an optional assets folder and a scale, then
`load_component(name, tsx)` and `render(SceneCall)`. `Renderer` wraps it for a
video and loads each component on first use; the Components playground and a
gallery drive `Engine` directly.

- Loading a name again replaces that component in the same engine: the hot
  reload path, tested in `tests/reload.rs`. A load that fails keeps the
  previous version.
- `scale` draws the same layout under a root transform: 0.5 is a 540p proxy
  of a 1080p video, identical in layout.

## Lint renders every scene at both ends

`Project::lint` loads each component once, checks every scene's props and
every component's `examples`, and renders each scene at `t = 0` and just
before `hold`, at scale 0.25, writing nothing. It collects every problem
with its scene and component instead of stopping at the first; an error is
reported once even if both ends hit it.

## `oculus studio` renders and lints from the terminal

- `oculus studio frame <DIR>` writes one PNG, by default to
  `<DIR>/out/frame-<t>.png` with `t` global; `--t S` or `--scene N --at S`
  pick the moment. It prints the path, the scene, its component, the
  scene-relative `t`, the size and the render time, then any component logs.
- `oculus studio lint <DIR>` prints each problem and exits 1 if there is
  any. With `--json` it prints the issues as an array of `{scene, component,
  example, kind, message, loc}`.

Flags are in [cli-reference.md](./cli-reference.md#oculus-studio).

## Golden frames pin the pixels

`tests/golden.rs` renders the fixtures in `tests/fixtures/` at fixed times and
compares them with `tests/golden/*.png`: a pixel differs when a channel is
more than 2 off, and at most 0.1% may differ. A failure writes the actual
frame and a diff image to `app/studio-core/target/golden-failures/`.
`STUDIO_BLESS=1 cargo test` rewrites the goldens. `tests/determinism.rs`
checks two renderers produce identical bytes, and `tests/isolation.rs` that
a frame is the same whatever the engine rendered before it.

From `app/studio-core`: `cargo test`, `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D
warnings`, `cargo fmt`. CI runs these in the `studio-core` job on macOS.

## Gotchas

- Each call starts from clean state: a top-level `let` resets every frame, so a counter or cache in module scope never accumulates — derive everything from `t`. A top-level `console.log` shows in every frame's logs, since the module runs again.
- Goldens are rendered on Apple Silicon; bless them on one, and keep the CI job on macOS.
- The crate's `[profile]` sections apply only to its own `cargo test`; built into `oculus`, src-tauri's profiles win.
- `flexDirection` defaults to `row`; a `Box` of lines lays them side by side.
- The JSX factory is `__studio_h`, so a component's own `h` variable is safe.
